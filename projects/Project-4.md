summary: RowRide website, for ridesharing/carpooling
---
For ICS 314, my team and I created a website for UH students to use as a website for ridesharing.  It promoted less traffic
on the roads and a safe way to connect with other students travelling to and from the same area.  The project was very fun as 
it was my first experience working with the backend coding aspect of software development.  It was definitely a learning experience
and gave me a look into something I may be doing in the future.  One small error within a component of the site could lead 
to some pages on the site not working, or even crashing the site as a whole.  

During this project, I worked on the database side of things.  I connected people who signed up as drivers and was able to display
a page that showed drivers, who they are and other information needed when making a decision to "ride" with them, kind of like what uber
does with showing a users profile.  I was also working on the my profile component, which shows the rides you've posted, and completed, 
along with working on smaller components and aspects on the site.  

I had lots of confusion and fun during this project, but seeing the final outcome is the best feeling of all.  Below are some pictures.
