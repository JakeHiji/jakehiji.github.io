summary: RowRide website, for ridesharing/carpooling
---
For ICS 314, my team and I created a website for UH students to use as a website for ridesharing.  It promoted less traffic
on the roads and a safe way to connect with other students travelling to and from the same area.  The project was very fun as 
it was my first experience working with the backend coding aspect of software development.  It was definitely a learning experience and gave me a look into something I may be doing in the future.  One small error within a component of the site could lead to some pages on the site not working, or even crashing the site as a whole. Being consistent and easily understandable is key when working in a group, meaning that when one groupmate types code, you should always be typing it in 
a way so that your group members can also understand it.  

During this project, I worked on the database side of things.  I connected people who signed up as drivers and was able to display
a page that showed drivers, who they are and other information needed when making a decision to "ride" with them, kind of like what uber
does with showing a users profile.  I was also working on the my profile component, which shows the rides you've posted, and completed, 
along with working on smaller components and aspects on the site.  

I had lots of confusion and fun during this project, but seeing the final outcome is the best feeling of all.  Having a fully functional site, one that you can use along with others, using accounts and connecting with eachother is a simple thing to use on the outside, but seeing how everything works on the inside is mind boggling.
