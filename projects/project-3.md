summary: My Eagle Project at Nuuanu Baptist Church
---

Pretty much all my life, I have been a cub/boy scout.  For my eagle project, I renovated a ramp, fixed it up to make it safer for kids going to and from the courts by added a railing.  This was a project took many months of planning and coordinating with the church and my boy scout troop.  With the help of my father, we were able to sucessfully install railing on the side of it to make it safer for everyone who goes to the church.  

This project was by far the biggest that I have been apart of/lead.  I was essentially the leader and on the day of working, I directed my fellow troop members to positions and their roles for the day.  Some helped with cement, while others helped to carry materials, etc.  This project required a lot of planning, the Boy Scout slogan is to "Be Prepared."  With this, no matter what circumstance, for example if it had rained, or someone got injured during the project, I would have to be ready for it.  This is where the planning came in, having a first aid kit ready, and writing a plan for any worst case scenarios.

I really enjoyed this experience and it taught me many life lessons.  One main thing that it taught me was to never procrastinate.  In Boy scouts, once you hit the age of 18, you can no longer advance in rank and you are essentially an alumni.  The point of this is to get to the rank of eagle scout (the highest rank in scouting) as quickly as you can before the age of 18.  With my peers and I, once you hit the age 17 you realize you only have one year left to accomplish this life-long mission.  Getting to the rank of Eagle Scout is no walk in the park.
