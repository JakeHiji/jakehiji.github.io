summary: I created a surfing style video game for ICS 111.

Throughout introduction to computer science 111, We did a number of different projects that were essentially "games" that we were able to create, test/play, and share with others.  The second big project that we had were assigned was a surfer style game in which we controlled a point or character on the screen using the wasd keys.  Coming into this project, I was very intimidated because of the many moving parts to this game but expected myself to take on and conquer the challenge.  We had to have the background moving in a horizontal motion with objects "floating" and moving at random speeds accross the screen so it would appear that my character was surfing across water in the left to right direction.  

This project took a lot of time to plan and execute, as I had no previous knowledge of coding in any language because this was the intro class into ICS.  This was the biggest project that I had done in java at the time, but with the help of the professor and the TA's and many long nights, I was able to produce a fully functioning game.  This project helped to teach me the basics of coding along with having good study habits.  These big projects cannot be done over night and take time to produce good functioning code so I had to be very responsible with the time given to us and not procrastinate.

My project specifically was a SpongeBob themed game in which the character that you control is spongebob on a seahorse.  As you start the game, it will load up and place you into the environment, krabby patties, lemonade, and jellyfish will fly across the screen at different speeds and at different positions.  On the top of the screen there are two meter bars, one for food and one for drinks, as the lemonade and krabby patties fly across the screen, you must eat and drink the objects before your meter hits zero, in which it stops the game and prompts you to eat or drink more based on which meter runs out first.  If you run into the jelly fish, both the food and drink meter will be penalized by decreasing it by a little.
