summary: My partner and I created a snake video game for our final project for ICS 111.
---

The snake game that I created for our final project involved a up, down, left, right travelling point which took input from the user, and a randomly placed point on screen.  If the point that you are in control of comes into contact with the randomly placed point, controlled points length increases, creating a snake.  It is a rendition of the classic snake game found online.  

This project took a lot of time to plan and execute, my partner and I had no previous knowledge of coding in any language because this was the intro class into ICS.  This was the biggest project that we both had done in java, but with the help of the professors and the TA's we were able to have a fully functioning game.  

This project helped to teach me the basics of coding along with having good study habits.  These big projects cannot be done over night and take time to produce good functioning code so I had to be very responsible with the time given to us and not procrastinate.
