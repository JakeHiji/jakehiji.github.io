summary: My partner and I created a snake video game for our final project for ICS 111.

The snake game that I created for our final project involved a up, down, left, right travelling point, and a randomly placed point on screen, if the point that you are in control of comes into contact with the randomly placed point, controlled points length increases, creating a snake.  It is a rendition of the classic snake game found online.
