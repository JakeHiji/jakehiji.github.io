## Why use Semantic UI?

Semantic ui is simple at first glance, seeing simple commands and code.  But when really broken down, can be very technical and head-scratching.  Semantic UI is simple, to someone who knows it well, but to a novice coder or web designer it is not so simple.  There are many parts to Semantic that are frustrating, first understanding divs, classes, and along with CSS which adds another factor of confusion.  With all of the attributes of Semantic, one may ask, why use Semantic UI?  The simple answer is performance and beauty.  Unlike using simple HTML coding without Semantic, you can build beautiful websites with many different features such as drop downs, menus, and so much more.  Things you are able to do on a regular HTML file are no where near the web building power that semantic has.  With Semantic you are fully capable to custmize every aspect of your site and make it look the way you envision a beautiful site to be.

## Personal Experiences
My personal experience with semantic had me sitting in front of my computer for hours trying to figure out the smallest little tweaks to perfect my site.  With a lot of moving parts, semantic is not at all simple to understand, and with my brief knowledge on the topic, I knew that perfecting or even getting better at the framework would take time.  I remember that simple problems arose in some of my first projects, some as simple as changing the color of the font on my site, or trying to top center allign my menu was just not working.  That is when I found out the power of div classes.  Understanding and being able to create custom classes definitely helped me understand how I can build a site to my liking.  

Working with Semantic UI was a fun experience because it dipped my foot into the world of web-development.  I have always been curious about the topic of how websites are built and this experience gave me some insight on how its done.  Hopefully, I can take the information and knowledge I gained from this and take it into the work force as I find web-developing very interesting and almost fun.  The satisfaction I gain when seeing a beautifully built site that I created is a very fun and fulfilling experience.  I do know that there is still a lot for me to learn in the world of HTML but I am very excited and optimistic about where HTML and Semantic UI take me in the future.
