## Enjoy the ride, you'll learn something
This semester was a rollercoaster, before and after the virus struck.  So many new ideas and concepts learned,
having to juggle ICS 311 and 314 assignments weekly while also working a part time job over 20 hours a weeks, and having 
everything come to an abrupt end.  Although it was a grind getting through these upper level computer science classes, I stayed 
along for the ride, kept my head down and did my work, and learned many new things about the world of Computers, development 
and coding in general, and sofware development skills beyond coding.  

## Why dont I get the Green Check!!!!!
When coding, whether working with a team or by yourself, you should always learn to type neat and nice code.  Teachers always 
say to write easy to read code, its not just for themselves when grading, but also for you to keep your project organized.  
One way people stay neat and organized when coding is through coding standards, which not only help to find errors, but to 
keep everything fluid and easy to read.  If your code meets the coding standards, not only are you being responsible for your
self but also helping out your teammates if your working on a group project.  Having and using the coding standards in a team 
envirnment helps to keep continuity between code, and to give your parters the best understanding when going back and reading your code.
Based on the IDE you use, you will get an alert if the code you are writting does not meet the coding standards, but for eclipse its a 
checkmark if it meets to standards, or a red X if it doesn't. This is a simple yet effective tool to help keep consistency 
and keep code looking clean and simple.

## User Interface
This semester was my first dip into website building and User Interface Frameworks, which are software to build ttools for 
building websites.  This semester we worked with Semantic and learned the fundamentals on making a website and attempting to 
make it look nice to the best of our ability.  There are many different UI's, like bootstrap, JQuery and many more.  Semantic for 
the most part is simple work with, but in no way am I saying that it is easy.  Front end developing is a very confusing yet satisfying 
upon completion.  Formatting is difficult because there are so many componenets within a website, and although you have access to changing every
single one, the question is do you know what you are changing and to what degree your changing it.  Putting a wrong command can lead to 
crashing a whole site simply because you misspelled a word or added an extra symbol to some place you shouldn't have.  Semantic is a 
very interesting and evergroing topic for me and I hope to work with it in the future.

There were many new things I learned this semester in Software Development, ICS 314.  This information I can take with me out into 
the real world hopefully in the future.
