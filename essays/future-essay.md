## Change of Heart

All of my life, I have been interested in technology, whether it be computers, phones, or anything of that sort, I always had a knack for finding out how things work and learning how to use technology.  I only started gaining interest about software engineering/development later in my life when I had started college.  Before then, in high school, I was always interested in the idea of learning how to write code but I never had the resources nor knowledge to find out where to learn and begin.  Coming into college, the idea of being a mechanical engineer interested me but I quickly realized that this is not what I really want to be, I wanted to study something more technology oriented.  That is when I talked to my friend who I realized was in my ICS 111 class, a pre-requisite for ME majors, about switching to computer science and realized that this field could be for me. 

## Work, Work, Work!
Once I officially switched my major, I quickly realized that this was going to be no walk in the park.  Although the material was difficult, I was able to learn the basic skills and practices of "coding."  These intro classes taught the fundamentals for software engineering such as loops, data structures, and so much more.  These skills, will definitely stick with me to use out in the field everyday in the future.  With this I hope to take my current skill set, develop and better it, and take it into the work force to make myself a more well-rounded programmer.  One thing that my CS courses taught me is procrastinating is never the answer.  Working 18+ hours a week and being a full-time student is very difficult at times, and sometimes overwhelming, I hope to better my time management skills.  Waiting till the last day to finish an assignment will (mostly) never produce quality work. 

## Goals and Improvements 
A big goal for myself is to work with or for a big company such as Apple, Google, Disney, etc.  I hope to experience this one day in the future.  I know to achieve this, I've gotta first study hard, work hard, and network which is a skill that I definitely need to improve.  Putting myself "out there" and developing my networking skills will help me with getting jobs and helping companies find out about me, who I am, what I can offer and bring to the table, and why I would be a good fit for their team.  I hope to one day, take my skills that I have learned and developed from UH Manoa and take it into the work-force when I graduate.
