## School is out, what now?
Never did I think there will be a day where my school was cancelled.  All my childhood, I had dreamt of this; of course not due to circumstances such as these but not having to go to school was always something I'd look forward to.  Now that it has happened, it feels crazy to me.  Now in college, I feel as though this is a relaxing time for me, being able to do homework, stay home, and essentially do nothing during this quarantine.  Not haveing to worry about waking up for classes in the morning is a plus, but do I really love my daily routine.  I've been going to sleep very late, and waking up in the afternoon.  It's nice being able to sleep in and do homework and assignments when I want to.

## Change is good?...
Before the classes came to an abrupt end after spring break, this semester has been a rollercoaster thus far.  Having to juggle 4 classes, two of them being ICS 314 and 311 was very difficult, while also work 20+ hours a week was no cake walk.  Now that the Corona Virus has taken over the world, I no longer have a job which gives me much more time to work on myself, studying, and doing things that I want or need to do.  Classes are also online now, which at first seems like a good thing, but I really miss going to class, it gave me a sense of motivation and drive to get my work done and pay attention, this goes for all of my classes.  Now, getting out of bed to do work seems like a drag, and its very difficult for me to focus on an asssignment when I have my ps4 and Nintendo switch calling out to me beside my desk at every second.  I really liked going to Sinclair library to get away from all of the distractions at home and solely focus on work.

I definitely need to change some of my current study habits in order to succeed this semester, whether it be removing my video game consoles out of my room, or fixing my sleeping schedule, I need to give myself an extra boost to get by this semester, consider the very unusual circumstances we as a society are in currently.
